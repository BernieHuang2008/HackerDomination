# Mission Manual _of **Password Cracking**_

## Background
Some sensitive files has been packed into a password protected ZIP file. You need to crack the password to get those files.

## Mission
1. Crack the password of the ZIP file
2. Extract the files
3. Copy all the files to the mission folder ("`/home/webserver/www/mission/`")
4. Close the shell, submit the mission.

## Key Info
- There's a user '`vault`' on computer, '`/home/vault`' stored all secret files.
- This server (Hostnaem: `TopVault`) also belongs to Peter Lee.
- Password of user '`webserver`' is a secret kept in '`pwd.zip`', vault.
- All passwords for ZIPs are 4-digit numbers

## Knowledge about Password Cracking
_(Generated by Copilot)_

Password cracking is a critical component of cybersecurity and digital forensics. It involves the process of recovering or guessing passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. The goal of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password, to gain unauthorized access to a system, or as a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily crackable passwords.

There are several methods used in password cracking. These include:

Brute Force: This involves trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method can be time-consuming, especially for complex passwords.

Dictionary Attack: This method involves using a list of common passwords or dictionary words. It's faster than brute force but less effective against complex passwords.

Rainbow Table Attack: A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions. It's used to crack password hashes, and is much quicker than brute force.

Social Engineering: This involves manipulating people into revealing their passwords. It's less a technical method and more a psychological one.

Keylogging: This involves recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.

Password cracking is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's an essential tool for security professionals to ensure system security and help users recover lost passwords. On the other hand, it can be used maliciously to gain unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data. Therefore, it's crucial to use strong, unique passwords and keep them secure to protect against password cracking attempts.
